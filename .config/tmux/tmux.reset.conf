# This configuration file is intended to reset/define a baseline for tmux keybindings.
# It's typically sourced at the beginning of the main tmux.conf.

# The line `unbind-key -a` (if uncommented) would remove ALL existing keybindings.
# This is a common practice to ensure a clean slate before defining custom bindings.
# However, it's commented out here, meaning default bindings are initially preserved unless explicitly overridden below.
# unbind-key -a

# --- Standard Tmux Command Bindings (mostly default or common overrides) ---
# Note: These bindings are for when the prefix key (e.g., Ctrl+A) has been pressed.

# Lock the tmux server (requires password authentication to unlock if a lock command is set).
bind ^X lock-server

# Create a new window, starting in the home directory.
bind ^C new-window -c "$HOME" # Note: Default is usually just 'c'. Ctrl+C here might be a custom choice.

# Detach the current client from the tmux session.
bind ^D detach # Note: Default is usually just 'd'. Ctrl+D here might be a custom choice.

# List all clients attached to the current session.
bind * list-clients


# --- Window Navigation ---

# Switch to the previous window.
bind H previous-window # Note: Default is 'p'. 'H' is a custom choice (like Vim motion).

# Switch to the next window.
bind L next-window # Note: Default is 'n'. 'L' is a custom choice (like Vim motion).


# --- Window Management ---

# Prompt to rename the current window. "%%" is a placeholder for the current window name.
bind r command-prompt "rename-window %%"

# Reload the main tmux configuration file.
# This is duplicated later; having it here ensures it's defined early.
bind R source-file ~/.config/tmux/tmux.conf

# Switch to the last active window (toggle between current and previous).
bind ^A last-window # Note: If prefix is Ctrl+A, this means Prefix + Ctrl+A. Default is 'L'.

# List all windows in the current session.
bind ^W list-windows # Note: Default is 'w'.
bind w list-windows  # This makes 'w' also list windows, which is the default.

# Toggle zoom for the current pane (maximize/unmaximize).
bind z resize-pane -Z

# Refresh the current client (redraws the screen).
bind ^L refresh-client
bind l refresh-client # Default is also 'Ctrl+L'. 'l' here is an additional binding.


# --- Pane Management ---

# Split the current pane horizontally (new pane below).
bind | split-window # Default is '%'. '|' is a common alternative.

# Split the current pane vertically (new pane to the right), starting in the current pane's path.
bind s split-window -v -c "#{pane_current_path}" # 's' is a custom choice. Default is '%'.

# Split the current pane horizontally (new pane below), starting in the current pane's path.
bind v split-window -h -c "#{pane_current_path}" # 'v' is a custom choice. Default is '"'.

# Choose a window from a list (interactive).
bind '"' choose-window # This is the default binding.


# --- Pane Navigation (Vim-style hjkl) ---

# Select the pane to the left.
bind h select-pane -L
# Select the pane below.
bind j select-pane -D
# Select the pane above.
bind k select-pane -U
# Select the pane to the right.
bind l select-pane -R


# --- Pane Resizing (Repeatable) ---
# The `-r` flag makes these bindings repeatable for a short time after the prefix.
# `-T prefix` ensures these are recognized after the prefix key.

# Resize pane left by 20 cells.
bind -r -T prefix , resize-pane -L 20
# Resize pane right by 20 cells.
bind -r -T prefix . resize-pane -R 20
# Resize pane down by 7 cells.
bind -r -T prefix - resize-pane -D 7
# Resize pane up by 7 cells.
bind -r -T prefix = resize-pane -U 7


# --- Miscellaneous Commands ---

# Open the tmux command prompt.
bind : command-prompt

# Toggle pane synchronization (send input to all panes in the current window).
bind * setw synchronize-panes # This reuses '*' which was earlier bound to list-clients. This might be an oversight or intended override.

# Toggle display of pane border status (shows dimensions, titles).
bind P set pane-border-status

# Kill the current pane.
bind c kill-pane # 'c' is a custom choice. Default is 'x'.

# Swap the current pane with the next pane (moves it down or to the right).
bind x swap-pane -D # 'x' is the default for kill-pane. Here it's used for swap-pane.

# Choose a session from a list (interactive).
bind S choose-session


# --- Configuration Reload and Clear Screen ---

# Reload the main tmux configuration file. (Duplicate of earlier binding)
bind R source-file ~/.config/tmux/tmux.conf

# Send "clear" command and then Enter to the current pane, effectively clearing the screen.
bind K send-keys "clear"\; send-keys "Enter" # 'K' is a custom choice.


# --- Copy Mode Keybinding (Vi-style) ---

# In copy mode (Vi keys), 'v' starts selection (like Visual mode in Vim).
bind-key -T copy-mode-vi v send-keys -X begin-selection
# In copy mode (Vi keys), 'y' copies selection and exits copy mode.
bind-key -T copy-mode-vi y send-keys -X copy-selection-and-cancel

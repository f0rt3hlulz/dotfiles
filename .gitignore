# This file specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore.
# Lines starting with '#' are comments.

# Ignore '.env' files.
# '.env' files typically contain environment-specific variables, such as
# API keys, database credentials, or other secrets that should not be
# committed to a version control system.
# Each developer or deployment environment might have its own '.env' file.
